Open Source Job Board
=====================

This repository contains the application we developed during our participation in the [Rails Girls Summer of Code 2013] (http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) project.
You can see it online at [jobs.punchgirls.com] (https://jobs.punchgirls.com/).

Description of project
----------------------
The Open Source Job Board is a job board for developers built with the Cuba microframework. The application uses the developer's GitHub information as a substitution for filling out a CV and aims to simplify the process of applying for job offers.
